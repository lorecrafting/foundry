# Dogfood log: the manual lane

The operator's running record of Foundry work driven through the manual lane
([runbook](LANE-RUNBOOK.md)). One entry per ticket, then the frictions found in the lane,
its tooling or the runbook. The lane store is the authoritative trail (`bin/pramana lane
log`); this log records what the operator saw and decided.

Roles: operator = an LLM session (Claude Opus 5.5); developer = a worktree agent
`agent:claude-opus-5-5/dev-<ticket>`; reviewer = a fresh Fable agent
`agent:claude-fable-5-1/review-<ticket>`, never a fork. Integration is manual: cherry-pick
onto `main`, one gate run per push.

## Setup, 2026-09-23

- Lane built and started with `bin/foundry-lane build` / `start` from `main` at `55037db`,
  fresh store under `~/.local/state/foundry-lane`, example policy (10 developer and 10
  reviewer starts for the store). `lane status`: `mode: ready`.
- Before the lane could run, the split cleanup landed directly (not through the lane):
  `FOUNDRY_MANUAL_LANE_REPO` defaulted to the checkout's parent, which no longer holds the
  repository.

## Tickets

| Ticket | Base | Candidate | Review | Integrated | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ML-CONTRACT-DIVERGENCES | `55037db` | `05e2f3c` | [approved](reviews/ML-CONTRACT-DIVERGENCES.review.md) | `93fb057` | record the four ledger/control divergences in the workflow contract. Developer verified all four against the code; found the B3 readings proposal's "no layer refuses issue under pause" is stale (the kernel now refuses, `control.ex:40-44`), left as a dated record |
| ML-RUNTIME-PATHS | `55037db` | `7a9b435` | [approved](reviews/ML-RUNTIME-PATHS.review.md), one low finding (Q2) | `1ae3c3b`, `8e61cd9` | agent prompts and generated scopes lose `foundry/` and `workflow/`. Developer also dropped `cd workflow &&` from generated checks and narrowed HardeningPM's leak check to `lib/pramana_foundry/`; found `preparation.ex:6` (`cwd: "workflow"`) and `local_exclude.ex:12` (`workflow/local/`) out of scope → next ticket |
| ML-WORKFLOW-DIR | `55037db` | `3fece1a` | [approved](reviews/ML-WORKFLOW-DIR.review.md), one low finding (Q3) | batch 1 | Preparation's deps.get runs at the root; LocalExclude defaults to `local/`. No `lib/` caller reaches `Preparation.commands` or the Pramāṇa-shaped database checks |

Batch 1 (the three tickets above) was cherry-picked onto `integ/lane-batch-1`, then run
through Linux CI on a PR and one local gate before `main` fast-forwarded.

## Operator questions and decisions

| # | Question | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | The `pramana-foundry-*` digest domain tags are persisted and checked on read (`record_codec.ex:258`); renaming them makes existing stores unreadable | **Decided 2026-09-23: hard rename, fresh stores.** The lane store is archived, not deleted, when that ticket lands |
| Q2 | HardeningPM's scope-leak check (`hardening_pm.ex:235`, `roles/hardening_pm.md`) now means `lib/pramana_foundry/` only, so an IMPRV ticket scoped to `test/` blocks its batch. Lib-only, or anything inside the checkout? | open |
| Q3 | LocalExclude's default `local/` is unanchored; `/local/` would match `.gitignore` but breaks `verify_protection`'s pathspec | open, low |
| Q4 | `Preparation`'s `@database_checks` (`ecto.create`) are Pramāṇa-project checks with no Foundry caller: delete, or keep for project profiles? | open |
| Q5 | Clean-room sweep Q1–Q12 ([sweep](../fr-23/CLEAN-ROOM-SWEEP-2026-09-23.md#7-operator-questions)) | **Decided 2026-09-23:** delete the legacy daemon stack and amend the plan ([C1–C4](../REPAIR-PLAN.md#clean-room-amendment)); archive FR-15aA; retire H0 + legacy import, Relocation, FR-19A sync-EIO, Assessor; operator hygiene done (legacy `local/`, `handoffs/`, `ci-artifacts/` removed; 3 worktrees, 2 merged branches and 12 `archive/2026-09-20/*` tags deleted). Q2–Q4 above become moot with the deletions |

## Frictions

| # | Where | What happened | Candidate fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | `bin/pramana lane …` | Every command prints the daemon's `[info] lane <cmd> started/finished` log lines around its result, so output needs filtering before it can be read or parsed | keep lane command logging off the RPC client's stdout, or only at debug |
| F2 | `.github/workflows/foundry-ci.yml`, AGENTS.md | CI runs only on pushes to `main` and on pull requests, but AGENTS.md said every push; a pushed branch got no run, so Linux CI needs a PR before `main` moves | AGENTS.md corrected; operator opens a PR per integration batch |
| F3 | GitHub CI | The handoff expected one known Linux failure; there were 107 (hardcoded `/private/tmp`, `/bin/zsh`). Linux runs 1229 tests against macOS's 1232: the three darwin-only filesystem tests in `operational_storage_test.exs:489` | fixed in `f8e6b44`; conventions now forbid both |
| F4 | reviewer briefs | Reviewers ran tests in the developer's candidate worktree; one used `git checkout -- .` for a red control (brief forbids it). Nothing uncommitted was lost, but a reviewer can alter the checkout the lane recorded | give each reviewer its own detached worktree at the candidate |
| F5 | `lane review --notes` | The store keeps only the notes' digest; the notes file lives in `/private/tmp` and would be lost | operator copies notes into `docs/batch-d/reviews/`; the lane could archive the notes body |
| F6 | lane end state | Nothing records `integrated` (risk A5): after cherry-pick, `lane status` still says `ready_to_integrate`, and the integrated SHA lives only in this log | an `integrate` command recording the main SHA |
